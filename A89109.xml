            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHereas we have endeavoured to Remon≈øtrate the danger and evill of the way you are in, and cleared the way unto what we have to propo≈øe, we ≈øhall with the ≈øame plainne≈ø≈øe and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, give you our apprehen≈øions of the remedies; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe upon all the rea≈øons and con≈øiderations aforegoing, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to offer, as followeth.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, we conceive and hope, that from what hath before been ≈øaid, you may find abundant cau≈øe to forbear any further procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in this evill and mo≈øt dangerous Treaty, and to return to your former grounds in the Votes of Non-addre≈ø≈øes, and thereupon proceed to the ≈øetling and ≈øecuring of the Kingdom without and again≈øt the King, upon ≈øuch foundations as hereafter are tendred; but if notwith≈øtanding all the evills and dangers remon≈øtrated to lie even in the Treaty it ≈øelf, you will ye proceed in ≈øuch an evill way, we ≈øhall at lea≈øt de≈øire that you make ≈øure to avoid that main venome and mi≈øchief attending it. viz. The Kings re≈øtitution with impunity, &amp;c. and that imperfect bargaining for partiall ju≈øtice again≈øt inferiour offenders; And for the avoidance of the≈øe, we propound.</p>
            <p>1. That you would reject tho≈øe demands of the King, ≈øent to you on his and his Parties behalf, and (e≈øpecially in relation to that concerning his re≈øtitution or return to London with freedom, &amp;c.) that it may be expre≈øly declared and provided by you, that, notwith≈øtanding any thing concluded, or to be concluded in this Treaty, the Per≈øon of the King may, and ≈øhall be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt in a way of ju≈øtice, for the blood ≈øpilt, and the other evills
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162437:3"/>and mi≈øchiefs done by him, or by his Commi≈ø≈øion, Command or Procurement, and in order thereto ≈øhall be kept in ≈øafe cu≈øtody as formerly.</p>
            <p>2. That for other Delinquents you would lay a ≈øide that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular bargaining Propo≈øition, which as we under≈øtand, the King hath refu≈øed in the termes you offered, and whereby all your ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice and mercy too would be rendred, to be dependant upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular contract, with, and grant from the King; and not upon the judiciall power of the Kingdom in Parliament; We therefore de≈øire.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That that capitall and grand Authour of our troubles, the Per≈øon of the King, by who≈øe Commi≈ø≈øions, Commands, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement, and in who≈øe behalf, and for who≈øe intere≈øt only, (of will and power) all our Warres and troubles have been, (with all the mi≈øeries attending them,) may be ≈øpeedily brought to ju≈øtice, for the trea≈øon, blood and mi≈øchief, he is therein guilty of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That a timely and peremptory day may be ≈øet for the Prince of Wales, and the Duke of York, to come in and render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, by which time (if they do not) that then they may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly declared incapable of any Government, or tru≈øt in this Kingdom, or the Dominions thereunto belonging, or of any kind of Right within the ≈øame, and thence to ≈øtand exiled for ever, as enemies and traytors, to dye without mercy, if ever after found and taken therein;) or if by the time limited, they or either of them do render them≈øelves, that then the Prince for his Capitall Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency (being in appearance next unto his Fathers,) may either be proceeded again≈øt in ju≈øtice, or remitted, according as upon his appearance he ≈øhall give ≈øatisfaction or not; concerning his being drawn into the rebellious engagements, he has appeared to head; and the Dake, as he ≈øhall give ≈øatisfaction, or not concerning his carriage in and ≈øince his going out of the Kingdom (being without leave) and in oppo≈øition or contempt of the Parliament and to the prejudice of the publike peace,) may accordingly be con≈øidered as to future tru≈øt, or not; But (however) that the E≈øtate and Revenue of the Crown may be ≈øeque≈øtred, and all the matter of co≈øtly pomp or ≈øtate ≈øu≈øpended for a good number of years, while the de≈øola ion and ≈øpoyles of the poor people made, by and in behalf
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:162437:3"/>of that Family, and for that vain intere≈øt (the ≈øtate and greatne≈ø≈øe thereof) may be in good mea≈øure repaired, or recovered; And that the Revenue (≈øaving nece≈ø≈øary allowances for the Childrens main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and to old Servants and creditors of the Crown, not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents) and al≈øo the 100000 l. per annum, Voted to the Crown in Liew of the Court of Wards, may for tho≈øe years be di≈øpo≈øed towards publike charges, debts and dammages for the ea≈øing and le≈ø≈øoning of the peoples Contributions towards the ≈øame; ≈øo as the E≈øtates neither of the friends to publike intere≈øt, nor alone of the inferiour Enemies thereto, may bear wholly the burthen of that lo≈ø≈øe and charge, which by and for that Family, the Kingdom or the good people thereof have bin or (for future ≈øecurity) ≈øhall be put unto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That for further ≈øatisfaction to publike ju≈øtice, Capitall puni≈øhment may be ≈øpeedily executed upon a competent number of his chief in≈øtruments al≈øo, both in the former and latter War, and (for that purpo≈øe) that ≈øome ≈øuch, of both ≈øorts, may be pitcht upon to be made examples of ju≈øtice in that kind, as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in your hands or reach, ≈øo as their exception from pardon, may not be a mockery of Ju≈øtice in the face of God and men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the ≈øatisfaction of Arrears to the Souldiery. with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publike debts. and the competent reparation of publike Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, (e≈øpecially and primarily of ≈øuch as voluntarily engaged for, and have con≈øtantly adhered to the common Cau≈øe, and ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the ≈øame) may be put into ≈øome orderly and equall, or proportionable way, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now (after publike ju≈øtice, had therewith the pre≈øent quieting of the Kingdom thus far provided for) we proceed in order, to the generall ≈øatisfaction, and ≈øetling of the Kingdom, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you would ≈øet ≈øome rea≈øonable and certain period to your own power, by which time that great and ≈øupream tru≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed in you, ≈øhall be returned into the hands of the people, from, and for whom you received it; that ≈øo you may give them ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and a≈ø≈øurance, that what you have contended for, again≈øt the King (for which they have been put to ≈øo much trouble, co≈øt, and lo≈ø≈øe of blood) hath been only for their Liberties and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intere≈øt, and not for your own per≈øonall Intere≈øt, or power.</p>
